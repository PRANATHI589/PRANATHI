<p>This project is aimed at developing a web based Leave Management Tool, which is of importance to either an organization or a college. <br>

The Easy Leave is an Intranet based application that can be accessed throughout the organization or a specified group/Dept. <br> This system can be used to automate the workflow of leave applications and their approvals. <br>
The Functional Requirements Specification documents the operations and activities that a system must be able to perform. <br>

Functional Requirements should include: <br>

Descriptions of data to be entered into the system <br>
Descriptions of operations performed by each screen <br>
Descriptions of work-flows performed by the system <br>
Descriptions of system reports or other outputs <br>
Who can enter the data into the system <br>
How the system meets applicable regulatory requirements <br>
